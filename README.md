## Design Documents: Blueprinting the Solution

### System Architecture

![System Architecture Diagram](./Images/MLOps-Projectt.jpg)

### Component Overview

#### 1. Orchestration Layer (Apache Airflow)
```
comprehensive_ml_pipeline_dag.py
├── Data Validation
├── Model Training (with variants)
├── A/B Testing
├── Decision Making
├── Model Deployment/Rollback
└── Notification System
```

#### 2. ML Training Pipeline
```python
# Hyperparameter Variants
- deep_forest: Deep trees with more estimators
- shallow_wide: Shallow trees with many estimators  
- conservative: Conservative parameters for stability
```

#### 3. Model Registry (MLflow)
- **Experiment Tracking**: Hyperparameters, metrics, artifacts
- **Model Versioning**: Immutable model versions with lineage
- **Model Aliases**: Production, staging, and candidate models

#### 4. Inference Service (FastAPI)
```
Endpoints:
- POST /predict: Real-time model predictions
- POST /reload: Dynamic model reloading
- GET /health: Service health status
```

### Data Flow

![Dag Workflow](./Images/dag.png)

1. **Trigger**: Scheduled daily execution or manual trigger
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and formatting of data
3. **Training**: Model training with specified hyperparameter variant
4. **Testing**: A/B comparison between latest model versions
5. **Decision**: Automated rollback decision based on performance
6. **Deployment**: Model promotion or rollback execution
7. **Notification**: Success/failure alerts with detailed metrics

### Key Design Decisions

#### A/B Testing Strategy
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **Decision Logic**: Rollback if latest model underperforms
- **Threshold**: Performance degradation tolerance

#### Rollback Mechanism
- **Trigger**: Automated based on A/B test results
- **Process**: Alias-based model switching
- **Validation**: Post-rollback performance verification
